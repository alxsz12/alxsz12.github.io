### Odometry Tutorial

First of all, what is odometry? Lets say that you moved 2 feet, but as you were slowing down you overshot the target. And then you went to the next target, but the extra distance traveled before is now added any you aren't at the target that you set. And this can keep on going on and on. 

Odometry is essentially the absolute position of where the robot is at all times.
