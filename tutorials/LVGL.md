### LVGL Tutorial

What even is LVGL? - LVGL stands for Light & Versatile Graphics Library. 

Essentially it is a library that creates a GUI, but with low memory footprint, so you don't have to worry about a display taking up all of your computer power. 

What the developers of PROS has done, is they have incorporated LVGL into the PROS software, and integrated it so that it can work with VEX V5 Brain displays.
