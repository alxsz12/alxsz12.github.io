### LVGL Tutorial

What even is LVGL? - LVGL stands for Light & Versatile Graphics Library. 

Essentially it is a library that creates a GUI, but with low memory footprint, so you don't have to worry about a display taking up all of your computer power. 

What the developers of PROS has done, is they have incorporated LVGL into the PROS software, and integrated it so that it can work with VEX V5 Brain displays.

> Note: You can just go to the [LVGL]() website for their tutorials, however it is NOT compatible with the version integrated into PROS. The intention of this tutorial is so that you have a tutorial that does work with the LVGL integrated into PROS. 

#### Widgets 

The first thing that you need to know about LVGL is essentially everything that can be displayed on the brain is called a "Widget". This is just a name for hte objects that are displayed onto the screen.
