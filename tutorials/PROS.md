#### Where to start?

First, we should start by installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
This is a free platform from Microsoft, which we will be using to program with the PROS extension. First things first is to download VS-Code for your computer. VS-Code is compatible with most operating systems. 

However, if you do not have a computer or a laptop that can install or run VS-Code, then you can go ahead and launch it through Google Chrome, by going [Here](https://vscode.dev/)

Now we need to install the PROS extension through the VS-Code Extensions.

Now we can just search PROS...

And press install

> Note: Now the next step is very important. After PROS is done installing you will be prompted with a message asking if you want to install the CLI, MAKE SURE TO CLICK INSTALL

#### First Project

Now that you have PROS installed, you can go ahead and create your first project. Now that you have PROS installed you should now see a new button on the side with the PROS Logo, so go ahead and select it. Then you should see a new panel pop up in you explorer.

From here go ahead and scroll down to the conductor section, and press "Create Project"

For this tutorial go ahead and select C++ as your language of choice, and then you will be prompted to selected where you want
to locate your PROS Projects. What I would recommend is that in your documents section, that you create a folder called VS Code Projects, and use that as the base to locate all of  your PROS Projects. Now go ahead and create your first project in that directory. 

PROS should now be up and running, and your first project should be open. Feel free to go onto any of the next tutorials!
