#### Where to start?

First, we should start by installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (website) 
This is a free platform from Microsoft, which we will be using to program with the PROS extension. First things first is to download VS-Code for your computer. VS-Code is compatible with most operating systems. 

However, if you do not have a computer or a laptop that can install or run VS-Code, then you can go ahead and launch it through Google Chrome, by going [Here](https://vscode.dev/)

Now we need to install the PROS extension through the VS-Code Extensions.
