### Auton Selector Tutorial

> NOTE: COMPLETE THE LVGL TUTORIAL FIRST [HERE](/tutorials/LVGL.md)

Why have an auton selector? It is pretty self explanatory. Lets say that you only have one auton path, this does not allow for variability if your alliance has the same side that you do. It is best if you can at least come up with two different auton paths to allow for the best chance to have the most success during the auton part. 

However, lets say that you wanted to go even further, and make 5 different strategies. Well the best way to be able to easily change through these autons is with a auton selector.

This tutorial will go over how to create a auton selector using LVGL to display a dropdown menu on the brain screen. 
>Note: This auton selector will require a Micro SD Card, explanation below, can be purchased [HERE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WW69YRD/ref=twister_B0BSYDVHBC?_encoding=UTF8&th=1) (It is recommended that you buy the 5 pack as it these are really cheap SD Cards, and the SD Card insert on the brain is known to break the cards from time to time)
