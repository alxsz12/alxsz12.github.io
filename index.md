This is a online development documentation website, made by Alex Seitz from Niles North Robotics Team 333R Los Robos. 
It was made to be used as a single place for Niles North teams to find programming tutorials, references, and is intended 
only to be accessed by Niles North teams. By only having it be accessed by Niles North Teams, we are allowing all of the 
notes on here to be in full detail, and fully explained, to help the success of the Niles North Vex Robotics Club.
